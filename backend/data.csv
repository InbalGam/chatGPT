Micro Pigmentation Histology Reports
In an experiment where blue pigment was introduced into pig skin and the results analyzed using histological examination, it was clearly observed that:

Depth of Penetration: The blue pigment managed to penetrate deep into the skin, reaching a remarkable depth of approximately 1,000 microns.
Width of Penetration: The spread of the pigment in the horizontal plane (width) was about 250 microns.
Penetration Point: The initial point where the pigment entered the skin was observed to be around 35 microns.

The most significant revelation from this study came from the histological examination. Histology involves the study of the microscopic anatomy of cells and tissues. In this context, the histological analysis showed:

Epidermis Preservation: Despite the depth and width of the pigment’s penetration, the epidermis remained undamaged. This is crucial because damage to the epidermis can lead to various complications, including potential infections, scarring, or other adverse reactions.
Promising Outcomes: The fact that there’s no observed damage to the epidermis while achieving deep penetration suggests that KolorPen non-invasive, needle-free method will have benefits in applications where deep skin penetration without surface damage is desired.

The histological examination, was conducted at a reputable institution: the Tissue Research Institute of Haemek Hospital in Israel.","Micro Pigmentation, Pigmentation, Beauty Enhancement, Semi-permanent, Cosmetic Technique, Facial Features, Scar Concealment, Injuries, Surgeries, KolorPen Technology, Non-invasive, Exceptional Precision, No Skin Contact, Accuracy, Hygiene, Minimized Infection Risk, Comfortable Experience, No Pain, No Skin Injury, No Epidermal Damage, Fine Lines, Histology Reports, Blue Pigment, Pig Skin, Depth of Penetration, Width of Penetration, Penetration Point, Microscopic Anatomy, Cells, Tissues, Epidermis Preservation, No Damage, Deep Skin Penetration, Tissue Research Institute, Haemek Hospital, Israel"

The treatment is carried out in a completely hygienic manner, reducing the risk of infections or complications. This is particularly important when dealing with sensitive areas like the face.

During the procedure, the Spider Veins lines are being delicately “drawn” with the therapeutic liquid. The application process is gentle and meticulously controlled, ensuring that only the targeted veins are treated.","Face, Spider Veins, spider, veins, Treatments, Innovative, Advanced technology, Accurate, Targeted approach, Affected areas, Procedure, Therapeutic micro-drops, Necessary depth, Skin type, Risk, Pigmentation, Adapted, Individual patient needs, Personalized approach, Hygienic, Infections, Complications, Sensitive areas, Lines, Delicately, “drawn”, Therapeutic liquid, Application process, Gentle, Meticulously controlled"
"Local anesthesia.
In the KolorPen procedure, a numbing agent like lidocaine is used to create micro-droplets of anesthetic solution. These droplets are then injected into the targeted area to induce numbness, minimizing discomfort during the treatment.

For instance, consider the hair transplant procedure at Dr. Ginzburg’s clinic. In this procedure, tissue from the back of the head is removed and then transplanted to a bald area at the front. This technique usually involves a significant amount of pain because it requires multiple needle insertions in both the area where the tissue is taken from (the donor site) and the area where it is transplanted to (the recipient site).

However, at Dr. Ginzburg’s clinic, this pain and discomfort are effectively mitigated using the KolorPen system. This technology enables Dr. Ginzburg to numb the respective areas in a pain-free manner before proceeding with the needle injections, thus making the whole process much more comfortable for the patient.","Local anesthesia, anesthesia, procedure, Numbing agent, Lidocaine, Micro-droplets, Anesthetic solution, Injected, Targeted area, Numbness, Discomfort, Treatment, Hair transplant, Dr. Ginzburg’s clinic, Tissue, Back of the head, Transplanted, Bald area, Front, Pain, Multiple needle insertions, Donor site, Recipient site, Pain-free, Technology, Comfortable, Patient"
"Tattoo Removal with Liquid composition
Overview

In the evolving world of tattoo removal, using a specialized liquid composition emerges as a gentle alternative to laser treatments. This method, favored for its lesser invasive nature, is revolutionizing the way people approach tattoo removal. At KolorPen, we are committed to bringing this innovative solution to you, providing an easier and more comfortable experience.

The Process

The process of tattoo removal using a liquid composition is simple and straightforward. The liquid composition is loaded into the KolorPen device. The KolorPen device then transforms this liquid composition into micro-droplets that are inserted to the area with the tattoo. These micro droplets help to break down the ink particles in the skin, which gradually fades the tattoo over several treatments. The technician will go over the tattoo in the same method the tattoo was applied however, this time, instead of ink, the liquid composition is inserted into the skin using KolorPen needle-free device.

Benefits

Less Painful: Unlike laser treatments, which can be painful, the liquid composition method is significantly less painful, providing a more comfortable experience.
Fewer Side Effects: This method comes with fewer side effects, reducing the risks of blistering, scarring, and hyperpigmentation commonly associated with laser treatments.
Suitable for All Skin Types: The liquid solution is suitable for all skin types, offering a versatile option for people with different skin tones and tattoo colors.
Affordable: This method is often more affordable compared to laser treatments, making it accessible to a larger group of people.
